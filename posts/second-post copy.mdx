# How to Brew the Perfect Cup of Coffee (with JavaScript)

Brewing coffee is both an art and a science. As developers, we love to automate thingsâ€”even our morning routines! In this post, we'll explore how to brew the perfect cup of coffee, and how you can use JavaScript to help.

## Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients

- Fresh coffee beans
- Filtered water
- Coffee grinder
- Scale
- Coffee maker (drip, pour-over, or French press)

## Step 2: Measure Your Coffee and Water

A good starting ratio is 1:16 (1g coffee to 16g water). Let's write a simple function to calculate the amount of water needed:

```typescript
function calculateWater(coffeeGrams: number, ratio: number = 16): number {
  return coffeeGrams * ratio;
}

const coffee = 20; // grams
const water = calculateWater(coffee);
console.log(`Use ${water}g of water for ${coffee}g of coffee.`);
```

## Step 3: Grind Your Beans

Grind size matters! For pour-over, use medium; for French press, use coarse. You can even track your grind settings in a JSON file:

```json
{
  "method": "pour-over",
  "grindSize": "medium",
  "notes": "Tastes best with fresh beans!"
}
```

## Step 4: Brew with Precision

Automate your brew timer with JavaScript:

```typescript
function startBrewTimer(minutes: number) {
  setTimeout(
    () => {
      console.log('Brew complete! Enjoy your coffee.');
    },
    minutes * 60 * 1000
  );
}

startBrewTimer(4); // 4 minutes for French press
```

## Step 5: Enjoy and Log Your Results

Keep a log of your brews to refine your process:

```typescript
type BrewLog = {
  date: string;
  method: string;
  coffee: number;
  water: number;
  notes?: string;
};

const todayBrew: BrewLog = {
  date: new Date().toISOString(),
  method: 'pour-over',
  coffee: 20,
  water: 320,
  notes: 'Smooth and rich flavor.',
};

console.log(todayBrew);
```

## Bonus: Build a Coffee Brew App

Why not take it further and build a coffee brew tracker app with React?

```typescript
import React, { useState } from "react";

type Brew = {
  method: string;
  coffee: number;
  water: number;
};

const BrewForm: React.FC = () => {
  const [brew, setBrew] = useState<Brew>({ method: "", coffee: 0, water: 0 });
  return (
    <form>
      {/* Form fields for method, coffee, water */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

Brewing coffee is a ritual, but as developers, we can make it even more fun and precise with a bit of code. Happy brewing!
