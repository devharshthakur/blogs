# A Beginner's Guide to Yoga for Developers

Yoga is a great way to improve flexibility, strength, and mindfulness. As developers, we often spend long hours at our desks, which can lead to stiffness and fatigue. In this post, we'll explore how yoga can help, and how you can use code to build healthy habits.

## Why Yoga for Developers?

- Reduces stress
- Improves posture
- Increases focus
- Boosts energy

## Simple Yoga Poses for Desk Workers

1. **Neck Rolls**
2. **Shoulder Shrugs**
3. **Seated Spinal Twist**
4. **Wrist Stretches**
5. **Standing Forward Bend**

## Setting Reminders with JavaScript

You can use JavaScript to remind yourself to take yoga breaks:

```typescript
function remindYoga(minutes: number) {
  setInterval(
    () => {
      alert('Time for a quick yoga break! 🧘‍♂️');
    },
    minutes * 60 * 1000
  );
}

remindYoga(60); // Remind every hour
```

## Tracking Your Yoga Sessions

Keep a log of your sessions to stay motivated:

```typescript
type YogaSession = {
  date: string;
  duration: number; // in minutes
  poses: string[];
  notes?: string;
};

const today: YogaSession = {
  date: new Date().toISOString(),
  duration: 20,
  poses: ['Neck Rolls', 'Seated Spinal Twist', 'Wrist Stretches'],
  notes: 'Felt more relaxed after the session.',
};

console.log(today);
```

## Building a Yoga Habit Tracker App

Why not build a simple tracker with React?

```typescript
import React, { useState } from "react";

type Session = {
  date: string;
  duration: number;
};

const YogaTracker: React.FC = () => {
  const [sessions, setSessions] = useState<Session[]>([]);
  // Add form and list rendering here
  return <div>Yoga Tracker App</div>;
};
```

## Tips for Staying Consistent

- Set realistic goals
- Practice at the same time each day
- Use reminders and trackers
- Celebrate your progress

## Conclusion

Yoga can be a powerful tool for developers to maintain physical and mental well-being. Combine it with a bit of code, and you have a recipe for a healthier, happier you. Namaste!
