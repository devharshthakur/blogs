## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors early and improves code quality.

```typescript
// A simple TypeScript function
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function greet(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}
```

## Why TypeScript?

- **Type safety**: Prevents many runtime errors.
- **Better tooling**: Autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation are improved.
- **Easier refactoring**: Large codebases become easier to maintain.
- **Great for teams**: Clear contracts between components.

## Getting Started

Install TypeScript globally:

```bash
pnpm add -D typescript
```

Initialize a TypeScript project:

```bash
tsx --init
```

## Type Annotations

Type annotations help you define what kind of data you expect:

```typescript
let count: number = 5;
let username: string = 'devuser';
let isActive: boolean = true;
```

## Interfaces and Types

Interfaces and types help you define the shape of objects:

```typescript
interface Post {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  content: string;
}

const post: Post = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'Hello TypeScript',
  content: 'TypeScript is awesome!',
};
```

## Generics

Generics allow you to write reusable code:

```typescript
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}

const num = identity<number>(42);
const str = identity<string>('hello');
```

## TypeScript with React

TypeScript works seamlessly with React:

```typescript
import React from "react";

type ButtonProps = {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
};

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
);
```

## Conclusion

Start your TypeScript journey today and experience the difference! The learning curve is worth it for the long-term benefits in code quality and developer happiness.
